# McqApp

The app opens at the login page where you can login using Facebook. It then redirects to the test page having 30 questions (10 each for Magnetism, Electricity and Physics). You can then submit the test and view the score per section in the form of a bar chart.

## Running the App

Clone the repository and run `npm install`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can also run `ng serve -o` to open the app directly in your browser. It will automatically navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`
